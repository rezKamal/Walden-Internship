# Walden-Internship

Includes code I have written for a SwatWorks micro-internship with Walden Local Meat Co.

### zipcodes.cpp

Implementation of the methods of the ZipCode class, parser functions for storing delivery and zip code data in memory, and functions that evaluate delivery algorithms based on different efficiency metrics.

### main.cpp

Takes in two inputs from the command line: a zip code and a date of last delivery. Returns the next delivery date based on both the original algorithm and the new one.

### validate.cpp

Takes in one input from the command line: 0 or 1. Program will test the original and new delivery algorithms by looking at average convergence times and success rates for each, based on the user's preference.
